For onlineGUI:
# 1) Add pedestal measures for trigger detectors
# 1) ADD SSH PATH FOR TRIG COMP
# 2) Add BC4 and others once TDC mapping is done
# 3) Fix reference histogram
# 4) Possibly add beam quality check -- ratio of BC2/VC, BC1/BC2, MWPC plot?
# 5) Should other detectors be here?? Maybe just for beam check

For quality check:
# 1) Add macros for US -- look at correlations of TQDC and TDC widths, other detectors, etc..

For ToF400:
# 1) George commit your path fixes
# 2) Add calibration macro to extract gamma peak
# 3) 

For A-2:
# 1)
